# How did I code

Used Swift language, and understood how much components in Instagram UI can be divided into images, text, button, etc. After that, for each components, code it in a new UI file and then integrated all of them into the ContentView.

Used features such as scrolls, and for each method to iterate many profiles and images in the UI to emulate the Mobile Instagram UI.

Most of the images and logos were credited through Gary Tokman's genorisity to the viewers.
